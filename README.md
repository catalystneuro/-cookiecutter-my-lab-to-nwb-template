# Cookiecutter template for CatalystNeuro projects
This repo serves as a generic template generator for all conversion projects undertaken by the CatalystNeuro team. The project is based and shares the structure of our[generic template](https://github.com/catalystneuro/my-lab-to-nwb-template) and extends it further by means of [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) to auto-generate the rest of the configuration.

## How to use it

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet:

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a CatalystNeuro conversion project structure:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/catalystneuro/cookiecutter-my-lab-to-nwb-template

This will ask some questions that determine the project structure (such as the lab and the name of the specific ongoing conversion) and generate a directory with all the basic structure for a conversion project. You can then modify this to suit the particular needs of the ongoing conversion.

The last step is to create an empty repo with the same name as the generated directory from our team [github account](https://github.com/catalystneuro) and just fill the contents with the ones in the directory generated by `cookiecuter`.
